-- Function composition operators

double x = x * 2
inc x = x + 1
square x = x * x

-- Left-to-right composition (>>)
double_then_inc = double >> inc
r1 = double_then_inc 5

-- Right-to-left composition (<<)
inc_then_double = double << inc
r2 = inc_then_double 5

-- Chaining
pipeline = double >> inc >> square
r3 = pipeline 3

-- Composition with pipe operator
r4 = 5 |> double >> inc

-- Right-to-left chain
r5 = (square << inc << double) 4
