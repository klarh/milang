# REPL

<!-- STUB: Cover the interactive REPL.

  ## Starting
  ```bash
  ./milang repl
  ```
  
  ## Features
  - Enter expressions to evaluate them immediately
  - Define bindings that persist across lines
  - Multi-line input: lines ending with operators or open parens continue
  - Previous bindings are available in subsequent expressions
  
  ## Examples
  ```
  > 2 + 3
  5
  > f x = x * 2
  > f 21
  42
  > map f [1, 2, 3]
  [2, 4, 6]
  ```
  
  ## Prelude
  - All prelude functions (map, filter, fold, etc.) are available
  - List and utility functions work immediately
  
  ## Limitations
  - No IO (no world available in REPL currently)
  - No imports
  - No multi-line blocks (use inline brace syntax instead)
  
  Reference: run `./milang repl` to try it
