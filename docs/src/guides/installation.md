# Installation

<!-- STUB: Cover these installation methods:
  1. Building from source (the only method currently):
     - Prerequisites: GHC 9.6+, cabal 3.10+ (Haskell toolchain)
     - Also needs: gcc (for compiling output C code)
     - Clone the repo, cd into it
     - `cd hs && cabal build` to build the compiler
     - `make` to build and symlink the binary
     - `make test` to verify (should show 60 tests passing)
  2. The binary is at: hs/dist-newstyle/build/.../milang
     - `make` symlinks it to ./milang in the repo root
  3. Optional: copy to somewhere on PATH
  4. Verify: `./milang repl` should start the REPL
  
  Note: milang compiles to C and shells out to gcc, so gcc must be on PATH.
  On Arch Linux: `pacman -S ghc cabal-install gcc`
  On Ubuntu: `apt install ghc cabal-install gcc`
